    Find the syntax error and document itand fix it

Line 23, it had syntax error: it was invalid character ( 'â€˜' (U+2018))
It did not have close ")"
After line 13, it was IndentationError: expected an indented block after function definition on line 13
    Find the semantics error and documentit and fix it

It was missing the code for break down the phone number.
It had extra the phone_str variable unnecessary. 
I put in the code with str() and count the posistion of the phone number.
